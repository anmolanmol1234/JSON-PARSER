This project work mainly deals with creating a JSON file parser using recursive descent parsing . The grammar of JSON is implemented and the JSON file is read token by token and checked whether each token is appropriately placed or not. If tokens are not correctly placed or undefined tokens are used according to the grammar, proper exceptions are thrown which lets the user know the position where the exception occurs.
